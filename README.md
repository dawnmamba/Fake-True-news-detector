## Overview

**VeritasML** is a comprehensive machine learning system for automated **fake news detection and classification**. The project implements and compares five distinct ML/DL approaches — from classical algorithms to state-of-the-art transformers — to identify misinformation in news articles. Built with rigorous preprocessing pipelines and evaluation metrics, **VeritasML demonstrates the effectiveness of different modeling techniques on real-world disinformation datasets**.

This repository contains the complete implementation including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation frameworks, and deployment-ready prediction modules.
